AN - Have not implemented error checking on function and system calls. It will be a lot of lines of code,
but I think it's generally easy and we can take care of it later.

SEAN: The problem I'm working on right now might take some discussion. The server takes the initial connection and can receive messages properly from that first user. When a second user connects, the array of user structs is populated correctly, and that user can chat as normal - but the first user now cannot send messages.
	This happens (I think) because they're trying to use the same pipes. I think we need to find a way to make the server create a new set of pipes for each user, which might take some redesigning of the program flow. I'm a bit at a loss of how to do that, but talking through it very well may help.

AN - I see what you're saying. I think we might just need to shift around some lines of code,
so that we initialize the pipes after the fork? I'll play around with it and update if I find
a solution.

AN - the usleep call is in microseconds, so not sure how long it should be for. I'm thinking
I'll go to office hours to ask, but 500 seems more suitable than the 2 which I initially put.
